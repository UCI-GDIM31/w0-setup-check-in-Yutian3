# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
My preferred name is Yutian Xie, but you can call me Yutian. My pronouns are she/her. I’ve experienced various types of games, and some of my favorites are visual novels, pixel puzzle games, and role-playing games. I’ve been involved in some game design projects before, though my role was mainly focused on art and storytelling rather than programming or technical aspects. Through this course, I hope to develop a game that combines my art style and unique ideas, particularly in genres like visual novels, puzzle games, or MMORPGs. Whether it’s a single-player or multiplayer game, I want to incorporate my designs and artistic vision to create original stories and visual elements.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [1] Other (please specify) 
    I’m currently a sophomore majoring in Film & Media Studies. Besides my personal interest in games, I’ve noticed that both film and games require a deep focus on visual design and audience interaction, which has sparked my interest in exploring this field further. Additionally, I’m considering a potential switch in majors due to the job market pressure in the film industry.

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I hope to learn the basics of programming and develop a simple game. In past game projects, I’ve only worked on art or scripts, which didn’t involve technical skills. As someone outside the GDIM major, I’m also contemplating a potential shift in my studies. This course will allow me to explore basic game programming, assess the course difficulty, and see if this path aligns with my interests. Beyond acquiring the skills to create a game independently, I also hope to determine whether game development is a career path I should pursue, helping me decide whether to switch majors and reorient my future career plans.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
I’m most anxious about the programming aspect of the course, which is also what I’m eager to learn. Since I have no prior experience in coding and haven’t taken related classes, I’m worried about struggling with it. I’ve always found STEM subjects like math particularly challenging, so I’m concerned that these difficulties might negatively impact my GPA. This could affect my academic plan, and that possibility makes me a bit anxious.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
N/A
2. Game development (any engine)
N/A
3. Unity
N/A
### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
N/A
2. Scope management
N/A
3. Iteration
